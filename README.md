**INTRODUCTION**

The chosen subject matter of this project revolves around the analysis of Human Development
Index (HDI) and its relationship with various societal factors. The HDI is a summary measure of human
development that was introduced in 1990 by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
The UNDP evaluates and ranks countries based on three fundamental dimensions of human
development: longevity, education and standard of living. Longevity is measured by life expectancy at
birth, reflecting the overall health and longevity of a nation's population. The education dimension is
measured through two metrics: expected years of schooling for children entering schools and the mean
years of schooling for the adult population. The standard of living is measured using the Gross National
Income (GNI) per capita. The purpose of this project is to uncover insights into how different aspects of
human development interact with one another and to understand how countries' development is affected
by a combination of factors, including gender inequality and environmental pressures. The motivation of
this project is to understand changing trends in HDI, investigate gender disparities and their impact on
development, and assess the environmental pressures affecting human development. Through this
exploration, we aim to generate valuable insights that can inform policymakers, researchers, and society
at large.

**DATASET**

The dataset is extracted directly from the official website of the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP). The dataset is created from Human Development Reports by UNDP and falls
under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO License. It is an open-sourced data by the UNDP for
research, academic, and policy-making purposes.

The dataset mainly focuses on the dimensions that the UNDP uses to compute the Human
Development Index (HDI) for 2021-2022. The dataset contains a total of seven tables that focus on
different human development composite indices. For this project, we will primarily focus on five tables that
are of interest which are: 

Table 1: Human Development Index and its components

  ● This table focuses on the three dimensions used to compute the HDI for different countries and
  includes metrics such as life expectancy, schooling years, and gross national income per capita.
  
Table 2: Human Development Index trends, 1990-2021

  ● This table provides information on the evolution of HDI values over the past decades for various
  countries.
  
Table 4: Gender Development Index

  ● This table offers insights into gender-specific development indices for various countries that
  focuses on the three dimensions of HDI.
  
Table 5: Gender Inequality Index

  ● This table provides insights on gender disparities in human development metrics across various
  countries.
  
Table 7: Planetary pressures-adjusted Human Development Index
  ● This table has metrics such as carbon dioxide emissions and material footprint that focuses on
  the environment considerations into traditional HDI, reflecting a broad view of development
  across different countries.
